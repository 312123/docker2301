manual method - https://github.com/bvijaycom/docker-jino/blob/master/images/redis/Alpine-Redis-Manual/command.txt
via Dockerfile - https://github.com/bvijaycom/docker-jino/blob/master/images/redis/Alpine-Redis/Dockerfile
via Dockerfile in ubuntu ---> https://github.com/bvijaycom/docker-jino/blob/master/images/redis/Ubuntu/Dockerfile

we can do 2 service in 1 container - but not recommended --> https://github.com/bvijaycom/docker-jino/blob/master/images/supervisord/Dockerfile
